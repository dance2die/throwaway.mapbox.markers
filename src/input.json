        "description": "<p>Using Finite State Machines To Develop Your React Application<br/>🎤 Lucas Reis</p> <p>In the React world, we have been obsessed with how to manage our state. There are lots of material on helping people choose between Redux, Mobx, or vanilla React state. But not a lot of attention has been given to state design. In this talk, I present Finite State Machines and how they can be a great tool to help you develop reliable components, understand your application state, and even communicating and collaborating with non-developers.</p> <p>Serverless And React (It's Just Sleight Of Hand)<br/>🎤 Marina Miranovich</p> <p>I bet, it's not a first time when you meet a word 'serverless', but I still hope that this time I persuade you to try it out. And for those who are familiar with AWS lambdas already I have a few handy tricks and tools to share. In my presentation, I'll show how to render and deploy an isomorphic React Redux application on AWS Lambda step by step.</p> <p>FLIP It… FLIP It Good<br/>🎤 Alex Holachek</p> <p>The FLIP technique helps us create performant animations that can make our UIs more beautiful and intuitive. First, I’ll review the basics -- what FLIP is and how it's implemented. Next, I’ll discuss why FLIP works particularly well with React’s lifecycle methods and its declarative approach to building the DOM. Finally, I’ll survey various types of FLIP animations, from the simple to the more advanced, as well a library I’ve been working on, react-flip-toolkit, that facilitates the implementation of complex FLIP animations in React.</p>",
